I built this site for a real estate service. 

The site is viewable here: https://codedeki.github.io/real-estate-site-css-grid/

## Front-End Web Development using modern practices including:
* HTML
* SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets - CSS Compiler) 
* _New_ CSS  Features: 
  * Mixins
  * Responsive Media Queries
  * Variables
  * Browser Supports/Prefixes
  * CSS Grid
  * and more!

_Note: Some features are incomplete as this site was built for fun._
